## OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite Study Guide

    ## Overview 
       This is to set out the layers of both the OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite and explain their respective purposes and overlaps.

        The OSI Model
        | Layer | Name         | Purpose                          | Example                                                               |
        |--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | 7            | Application  | Process to Process Communication | Ensuring the use of proper protocols, such as HTTP                    |
        | 6            | Presentation | Translates between data formats  | Compressing a file for transport and decompressing for use in layer 7 |
        | 5            | Session      |                                  |                                                                       |
        | 4            | Transmission |                                  |                                                                       |

        | 2            | Data Link    |Transmits data between physically connected nodes|Switches operate at layer 2                             |
