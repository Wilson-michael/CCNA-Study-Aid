## Study Guide for the Security Fundamentals portion of the CCNA exam

# Overview

This will be a study guide for the Security Fundamentals portion of the CCNA exam. It will cover [key security concepts](#key_security_concepts), [common attacks](#common_attacks), [passwords and multi-factor authentication_ MFA)](#passwords_and_multi-factor_authentication_(MFA)), [authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)](#authentication,_authorization_and_accounting_(AAA)), and [security program elements](#security_program_elements).

# Key security concepts

First, what is the goal of "security" when it comes to networking in an enterprise setting? It can be summed up using the principles of the "CIA Triad".

C- Confidentiality. This is the concept that data should only be accessible to authorized users, whether it's public data that's open to anyone, or secret data that is only for certain people.

I- Integrity. The integrity of data is maintained by preventing unauthorized users from modifying the data, and ensuring that it is correct and authentic.

A- Availability- Networks and systems should be in good operating order, and accessible to an authorized user.

Along with the CIA Triad, there are some fundamental concepts to keep in mind when considering security.

First in line are _vulnerabilities_. These are potential weaknesses with the ability to compromise the CIA of a given system. 

Next are _exploits_, which can potentially be used to take advantage of vulnarabilities. 

While these two things aren't problems on their own, the become a _threat_ when a hacker exploits a vulnerability.  

In order to protect against threats, _mitigation techniques_ should be implemented anywhere a vulnerabilty can be exploited, such as client devices, servers, switches, routers, and firewalls. Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfectly secure system, and you should approach everything you do with that concept as your guiding principle.

# Common Attacks

There are many different ways that a system can be attacked,but we will only cover a few. See the table below.

The reflector then sends replys to the targets IP address, which, if the amount of traffic is large enough, results in DOS. One way that this can be accomplished is by the reflection attack becoming an amplification attack, wherein the traffic sent by the attacker is small in size, but it triggers a large amount of traffic to be sent from the reflector to the target, typically a TCP/UDP based service                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Block unsolicited DNS replies, especially from outside clients, and detect and remove unwanted replies based on similar patterns                                                                                          |

One common example is ARP spoofing, where a host sends an ARP request for the MAC address of another device. The ARP request reaches both the intended destination and the attacker. The target the replies with its MAC address, which is added to the requesting devices ARP table. The attacker waits, and sends another ARP reply shortly after the legitimate device, meaning that its address replaces the legitimate one, and all traffic from the first device meant to reach the target device will instead be directed to the attacking device,where data can be read or modified before being forwarded to the original destination | The use of VPNs when on a public wi-fi network, the implementation and use of strong passwords, 2 factor authentication (2FA), and data encryption                                                                        |

One example is a _virus_, typically contained in software (a host program) shared by users, which then infects other software in order to corrupt or modify files on the target device. Another is a _worm_, a standalone malware program that spreads without the need for a host program or user interaction. These worms can cause network congestion, and sometimes carry _payloads_ to cause additional damage to targets. A final case would be the _trojan horse_, harmful software disguised as a legitimate program or file. Like Viruses, they are spread through user interactions, including opening email attachments or downloading infected files from the internet                                                                               | Installing Malware protection, maintaining awareness of emerging malware and dispersion methods, and ensuring proper safety protocols are followed by all users when it comes to sharing or dowloading software and files |
|Social Engineering|Can affect all three aspects of the CIA triad|Unlike the other attacks in this table, these attacks are specifically designed to target the human component of network security. There are many different ways that attackers can utilize psychological manipulation to gain information or cause a user to perform an action. One major strategy is that of _phishing_ and its descendent techniques. Phishing is typically done through email, _vishing_ is through a phone call, and _smishing_ is through sms messages. They all appear to come from a legitimate business or person, and aim to convince a user to give them information such as bank account, credit card or social security numbers, usernames,passwords and other sensitive personal or professional information. _Watering hole attacks_ compromise sites that target users visit on a regular basis, oftentimes placing a malicious link on said website that a user will click without a second thought. As a final example is something known as _tailgating_, where an attacker will enter a restricted physical space simply by walking in directly behind an authorized person, who will often even hold the door open for them|Education of users and authorized personnel is the best way to ensure that social engineering attacks don't succeed. Sensitive information and physical spaces need to be treated as such, 
|Password Related|Affects the Confidentiality and Integrity of a system|These attacks use the fact that most systems require a username/password for user authentication. Usernames are typically easy for an attacker to guess or obtain, so the strength and security of a users password is also the strength and security of the system. There are several ways that an attacker can obtain a users password. First is simply guessing, based on either personal information on the user or generic passwords that may be in use, e.g. "password123". Second, the _dictionary_ attack, in which the attacker uses a program to run through a 'dictionary' (list) of commonly used passwords until a match is found. Lastly is a _brute force_ attack. This uses a program to go through every possible combination of words and letters to come up with a users password. This requires an extremely large amount of computing power|Basic password security is the simplest way to ensure that password attacks are unsuccessful. Have a list of banned passwords, ensure a minimum of 8 characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Require that passwords be changed regularly. Implement 2FA or MFA for extra protection|

# Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

In essence, MFA is a security measure requiring a user to provide more than a username and password to prove their identity. Usually, it involves providing two of the following factors, also known as two-factor authentication (2FA):

Something you know: A username and password combination, a PIN, etc.

Something you have: Pressing a notification on your phone, using an authenticator app, a badge that can be scanned, etc.

Something you are: A biometric measure such as a fingerprint scan or facial ID.

Another form of authentication is the use of _digital certificates_ to prove the identity of the certificate holder. These are used for proving that websites are legitimate before being accessed. These are obtained by an entity sending an Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to a Certificate Authority (CA) that generates and signs the certificate.

# Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)

AAA is a framework for controlling and monitoring the users of a computer system.

Authentication is the process of verifying a users identity, typically through a login process (e.g. requiring a username/password combination or MFA).

Authorization is the process of ensuring that the user has the privileges necessary to access the information or device that they are attempting to use.

Accounting is the process of making a record of the users activities on the system. (e.g. logging file changes made by the user)

These processes are usually serviced by a AAA server. In Cisco's case, this server is Identity Services Engine (ISE). They typically support the AAA protocols RADIUS, an open standard protocol that uses UDP ports 1812 and 1813, and TACACS+, Cisco's proprietary protocol that uses TCP port 49.

# Security Program Elements

There are multiple facets that make up a successful Enterprises Security Program. 

First are _user awareness programs_. These are designed to make employees more aware of possible security threats and risks. An enterprise could send out false Phishing emails, requiring users to click a link to an external site and enter login credentials. The company would then let employees who had done so that it was a part of a user awareness program, and they need to be alert for other phishing emails.
